# Gurobi model for a multi-product lot-sizing and scheduling problem with remanufacturing, lost sales and sequence-dependent cost.

This repository contains Gurobi codes for MILP described in the ICCL 2023 submission.
## How to start

1. Download the codes from this repository
1. Open the files with [Spyder][(https://www.anaconda.com/download)]
1. Install gurobipy and obtain a license for gurobi [https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/12872889819921-How-do-I-use-conda-to-install-Gurobi-in-Anaconda-]
1. Build and Run the solution

## Files
1. The file https://github.com/LucasGana/ICCL/blob/main/ELSPR_LSC_DETERMINISTIC.py contain the MIP.
1. https://github.com/LucasGana/ICCL/blob/main/InstanceGenerationsICCL_LP%20(1).py Here, both the branch-and-cut algorithm and the instance for the linear relaxation problem are generated.
